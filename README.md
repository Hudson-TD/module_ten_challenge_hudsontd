  #  Team Profile Generator
  
  ## Description
  The goal of this project was to create an appliation that can be initialized in the terminal that yields a fully generated and styled HTML file. The contents of this file display the composition of an internal team containing a 'Manager' along with 'Engineer' & 'Intern' employees. This was accomplished by using Inquirer to create the data collection prompts, Node.js as the runtime environment, Bootstrap for styling, and finally Jest for unit testing.

## Installation
  To install simply start by downloading the repository. Once downloaded proceed to open the terminal and run the following command: 'npm init'. Lastly run the 'npm install' command in the terminal to install all of the necessary npm packages.
## Usage
  Entering 'Node index.js' into the terminal will prompt the user to create a team starting with the 'Manager'. Afterwards the user can proceed with creating additional employee cards within the html by selecting the 'Engineer' and 'Intern' options. The answers to the prompts for each employee type will dynamically create employee cards in the HTML along with some values reflecting as hyperlinks such as github for the 'Engineer'. The user can create as many 'Engineer' or 'Intern' cards as needed. The user will be prompted to continue adding additional team members after each entry which can be stopped by pressing 'N' when prompted.
